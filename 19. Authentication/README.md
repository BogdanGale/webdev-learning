## Synopsis

Here I have learned about user authentication by using the Express middleware: passport.

The application allows you to sign up, log in and log out with a local account and it maintains persistent login sessions.

## Technologies used:

- [passport module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
- mongoDB
- Express JS

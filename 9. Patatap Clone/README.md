## Synopsis

A simpler version of the [Patatap](https://patatap.com/) website on which you can press any alphabethical character on your keyboard and a circle will appear on a random spot on the screen, which shrinks as a certain associated sound is played.

In this project I have learned to work with the HTML5 canvas and with a couple of JavaScript libraries, PaperJS and Howler.

## Technologies used:

- PaperJS
- HowlerJS
- CSS
- HTML Canvas

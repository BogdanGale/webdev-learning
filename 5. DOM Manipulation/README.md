## Synopsis
The most boring game ever.

I have used DOM Manipulation in this game in which you can set a number to which the score goes up to and you click on two buttons, player 1 and player 2, each click adds a point to the player's score and whoever reaches the previously set score limit wins the game, the winning player's score turn green and the player buttons become disabled.

If you want to play the game again, there's a reset button that restarts the game.
